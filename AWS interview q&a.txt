1. Can you explain about any 5 aws s3 cli commands?

a: aws s3 mb
   aws s3 rm
   aws s3 ls
   aws s3 cp
   aws s3 mv

2. How do you protect data at rest in s3?

a: You have to use AWS KMS service to encript the data at rest from the server side.
   You have to use AWS DKS service to encript the data from the client side.
   

3. Explain when do you use CLB vs ALB vs NLB.

a: ALB- layer 7, path based routing, attach WAF
   NLB- layer 4, video streaming
   CLB- legacy, doesn't support TG

4. What is the difference between EBS, EFS and S3?

a: EBS > a block storage
       > not a stand alone storage
       > fixed storage capacity
       > used commonly for faster read and writes for your EC2 instance
       > you have to create EFS to start using the volume
   
   EFS > in-built file system intelligence
       > can be utilized for shated volumes
       > accessed by multiple EC2 instances

   S3  > an object storage
       > stores static data
       > great for storing logs

5. *Types of EC2 instances?

a: R- memory optimised
   C- compute optimised
   M- medium
   I- storage optimised
   G- GPU
   T- burstable

6. When do you use nested cloudformation templates and is there any specific policy that tou set?

a: 

7. Explain about any 5 cloudformation funtions.

a: > Fn::Join
   > Fn::Select
   > Fn::FindInMap
   > FN::Base64
   > Ref

8. Explain how DDoS attacks can be prevented using AWS.

a: 

9. How do you monitor Applications HTTP errors responses running on AWS?
   (explain if application runs on EC2 vs LB)

a: 

10. Difference between Aurora vs RDS.

a: Aurora > scales automatically
          > faster
          > costlier

11. Suppose you have an application DB in RDS without any manual back-up (DB Snapshot). Your RDS-instance went to a failed state. What steps would you take right now and in the future?

a:
